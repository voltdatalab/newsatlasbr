`newsatlasbr` is a package created to give easier access to the datasets of the [News Atlas](https://www.atlas.jor.br/english/) project, which is an initiative that researches and maps news organizations in the Brazilian territory.

The package facilitates data extraction from the project [open-data API](https://www.atlas.jor.br/plataforma/api/), developed by [Volt Data Lab](https://www.voltdata.info/en-lg).

## Installing and loading the package

Currently, the `newsatlasbr` package can be installed directly from its GitHub repository:

```{r install, eval=FALSE}
if (!require("devtools")) install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("voltdatalab/newsatlasbr")
```

Once installed, it can be loaded using the library function.

```{r setup}
library(newsatlasbr)
```

## Functions

`newsatlasbr` has three groups of functions: 

* Sign-in to the API to retrieve a token;
* Get aggregate data from municipalities, states or regions and map those data;
* Get data on the news organizations.

This tutorial goes over those groups.

### Signing in to the API

To access News Atlas' API, users [should be registered](https://api.atlas.jor.br/login) and insert their e-mail and password for authentication. `atlasbr_signin` function registers these information on the current R session, so that it can be used to obtain the Bearer token to extract data using the API.

As noted, the function sets the e-mail and password in the current R environment. Thus, users should repeat this operation on every new R session in which they intend to use the `newsatlasbr` package. *We stress that user and password are personal. Therefore, users should be careful when writing and saving them in R scripts, in order to avoid sharing these information*.

```{r signin, eval = F}
atlasbr_signin(email = "example@account_exeample.com", password = "pass")
```

### Aggregate data from municipalities/states/regions

Users who already got to explore articles or reports about News Atlas know that municipalities are classified into 3 categories, according to the number of news organizations in them:

* **News deserts**: no news organizations;
* **Almost deserts**: 1 or 2 organizations;
* **Others**: 3 or more.

The `get_municipalities` function combines API requests for the 3 categories above to create a single dataset containing the number of news organizations in each municipality and other municipality-level information. Since it does 3 requests to the API, it takes longer to run than the other functions that only extract the raw data. However, it is the only one that gives a full picture for the 5,565 municipalities.

The following functions have a similar structure (no arguments) and returns the following datasets:

* `news_deserts`: municipalities that are *news deserts*;
* `almost_deserts`: municipalities that are *almost deserts*;
* `n_orgs_100k`: municipalities with *at least 1 news organization*, informing both the *absolute* and *the rate per 100,00 inhabitants* number of news organizations.

```{r aggregate1, eval = F}
all_municipalities     <- get_municipalities()
deserts_municipalities <- news_deserts()
almost_deserts_muns    <- almost_deserts()
at_least_1_org_muns    <- n_orgs_100k()
```

Those last three functions also have pairs, who allow the extraction of aggregate data for states/regions:

* `news_deserts_state`: returns a dataset with the aggregate number of *news deserts* in each state or region. `(regions = F)` is the default;
* `almost_deserts_state`: returns a dataset with the aggregate number of *almost news deserts* in each state or region. `(regions = F)` is the default;
* `n_orgs_100k_state`: returns a dataset with the *absolute* and *per 100,000 inhabitants* number of news organizations in the state *and* region. This function is slightly different from the previous two, since the returned dataset always contains 27 observations. If `regions = T` (which unlike the others, is the default), new columns are added to each observation, including information on the region where the state is located.

```{r aggregate2, eval = F}
news_deserts_states     <- news_deserts_state()
almost_deserts_regions  <- almost_deserts_state(regions = T)
organizations_per_state <- n_orgs_100k_state()
```

Finally, `newsatlasbr` also include three functions to easily generate and export maps on these information, using spatial data from the `geobr` package and graphichs from `ggplot2`:

* `news_deserts_map`: plots a map of Brazilian news deserts. Data can be on the municipal, state or regional-level (all three functions have `aggregation = "municipalities"` as the default). For states and regions, the user should choose if the visualization should display the *absolute* number of news deserts municipalities (default) or the *percentage* of those in each unit. As in the other functions, the user can export the map as a .jpg file with the argument `export = T`.

```{r aggregate3, eval = F}
# Plot map of the percentage of news deserts municipalities in each Brazilian state
news_deserts_map(aggregation = "states", percentage = T)
```

* `almost_deserts_map`: plots a map of Brazilian almost news deserts. Data can be on the municipal, state or regional-level. Unlike the `news_deserts_map` function, the user can only plot the *absolute* number of almost news deserts municipalities in each unit.

* `n_orgs_100k_map`:  plots a map with information on the number of news organizations per 100k/inhabitants. Data can be on the municipal, state or regional-level.

```{r aggregate5, eval = F}
# Plot map on the number of media orgs per 100k/inhab in each municipality
n_orgs_100k_map()
```

### Data on news organizations

There are two functions to extract data on Brazilian news organizations: `organizations_state` and `organizations_region`. Both have a similar structure: their default arguments returns data from the state/region provided (the user can set `uf = "All"` or `region = "All"`, but she should note that it takes a bit longer to load); only news organizations (`news = 1`) and all types of organizations (`media = all`).

So, the user can choose to retrieve data for the whole country, as previously said. She can also get all media organizations (`news = "all"`), meaning both news organizations and other media. And finally, she can restrict her dataset to only a subset of medias, such as "print", "online", "radio" or "tv". 

```{r news_orgs, eval = F}
# Extract data on all news organizations from the state of SP
sao_paulo_media <- organizations_state(uf = "SP")

# Extract data on all news organizations from the country
brazil_media <- organizations_state(state = "all")
brazil_media <- organizations_region(region = "all")

# Extract data from print media in Pernambuco
pernambuco_print <- organizations_state(state = "PE", media = "print")

# Extract data on TV media in the Central-West region
cw_tv <- organizations_region("Central-West", media = "tv")
```
